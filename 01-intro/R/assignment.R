# import the "midwest" dataset from ggplot2 (tidyverse package)

# briefly describe what the dataframe is generally about (no statististics)

# how many states and counties are in the data?

# calculate all population statistics on the state level
# you can create a new dataframe for each step or do it in one go

## 1. add population counts and are grouped by state
## hints: use "group_by" and "summarise" with "across" and "everything()"
## also: you are allowed to use the internet for help!

## 2. build a function to calculate percentages
## inputs: total population and part of population
## output: the percentage value

## 3. produce a new colum with statewide percentages
## for all populations

### a) do this with the function defined above

### b) do this within tidy

# which state has the highest percentage of inhabitants identifying as
# amerindian?

# in preparation for the next workshop:
## go through the cleaning script (03-cleaning_viz.R) by yourselves!
