17640;A big, flashy, unguided spoof that wanders around and bores you to sleep.;
17641;So bizarre, so wrongheaded, and so overblown that it's actually enjoyable.;
17642;Note to filmmakers: If you want to spoof something, at least make sure you're outdoing your source material on the comedy front.;
17643;Despite a ton of stars, a flock of directors, and more Bonds than you can shake a martini at, the movie is close to a complete disaster.;
17644;There is a razor thin line between being funny and being stupid.;
17645;NA;
17646;NA;
17647;NA;
17648;NA;
17649;It's a spoof that went places even James Bond feared to tread.;
17650;Audiences generally will find this an undisciplined, loosely done, hectic free-for-all that is completely confusing.;
17651;It may, in fact, be the first post-modern comedy, but it feels more good-natured than snarky -- and there's an undercurrent of true British satire here.;
17652;Profoundly unamusing bore.;
17653;...a definitive example of what can happen when everybody working on a film goes simultaneously berserk.;
17654;Even more awful considering the wasted talents.;
17655;NA;
17656;Watching this movie is a serious drag.;
17657;It's the sort of reckless, disconnected nonsense that could be telescoped or stopped at any point.;
17658;...only a very small minority of those acquainted with the more arcane aspects of <DATE>1960s</DATE> cinema are going to have some appreciation for CASINO ROYALE.;
17659;Even less amusing than the more 'serious' Bond films.;
17660;The few good aspects of this farce are vastly outweighed by the bad.;
17661;It's cheesy, cheesy, cheesy.;
17662;No less than five directors, including <PERSON>John Huston</PERSON>, and eight writers, including <PERSON>Billy Wilder</PERSON> and <PERSON>Ben Hecht</PERSON>, tried to salvage this lengthy, laden all-star Bond spoof--to no avail.;
17663;Now <PERSON>Craig</PERSON> assumes the mantle, and you know, he does OK.;
17664;<PERSON>Peter Sellers</PERSON> has some amusing gags as the gambler, the chance of dressing up in various guises and a neat near-seduction scene with <PERSON>Ursula Andress</PERSON>.;
17665;A mess. Casino Royale is two hours and eleven minutes of non sequitur.;
17666;Out of five directors -- only <ORGANIZATION>McGrath</ORGANIZATION> manages to connect with this brontosaurian James Bond parody.;
17667;Surrealisticly bad;
17668;Chaotic and astonishingly unfunny.;
17669;Despite being not officially a Bond film this is good solid, entertaining action.;
17670;Poor 007 is now lost in a hall of distorting mirrors.;
17671;Silly 007 spoof tamer than <ORGANIZATION>Austin Powers</ORGANIZATION>.;
17672;A magnificent mess, it's either the greatest argument against LSD or the worst.;
17673;Proponents of this dreadfully indulgent cabaret, which thumbs its nose at coherence, have called its nigh-impenetrable plot the sincerest form of satire. That's like citing the indecipherable nature of Zapf Dingbats as a foremost send-up of language.;
17674;A surfeit of screenwriters (eight, including <PERSON>Billy Wilder</PERSON>) and directors (five, including <PERSON>John Huston</PERSON>) lends the whole a chaotic, disjointed air, but there is much fun to be had along the way.;
17675;The melodrama has been staged on a lavish scale and everybody quite literally acts out the window.;
17676;Things pick up a little bit when <LOCATION>Orson Welles</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Peter Sellers</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Woody Allen</PERSON> stumble into the scene, but the total experience remains boringly incoherent.;
17677;If <LOCATION>Casino Royale</LOCATION> has what passes for its heart set on dealing the final death-blow to a n over-worked legend, how sad that it didn't perform the necessary obsequies with style.;
17678;I cannot even recommend the film in any half-hearted manner. It's insulting to moviegoers, it's insulting to me, and it's insulting to Bond.;
17679;A few innovative sets, a wealth of eye-popping colors, and oodles of bared midriffs can't redeem this juvenile experiment in adolescent fantasy.;
227341;<PERSON>Daniel Craig</PERSON> is the best Bond since <PERSON>Connery</PERSON>.;
227342;<PERSON>Daniel Craig</PERSON> is probably the best and most serious actor to have been cast as 007 and this film makes full use of his range.;
227343;You'll be shaken. You'll be stirred. Heck, you'll be blown away.;
227344;This is a prototype Bond we have never seen before. It seems we have underestimated you, Mr <PERSON>Craig</PERSON>.;
227345;By the end of a curiously back-to-front film, when he finally gets his theme tune and introduces himself -- 'Bond. James Bond' -- he, like the creaky franchise itself, seems profoundly unsure whether he is coming or going.;
227346;Contrary to pre-release nay-sayers, <PERSON>Daniel Craig</PERSON> has done more with James Bond in one film than some previous stars have in multiple reprises. This is terrific stuff, again positioning 007 as the action franchise to beat.;

227348;<PERSON>Daniel Craig</PERSON> gives a stunning performance (the best Bond since Connery), but the film shows strain between delivering the franchise's basic goods and a fresh character-driven tale.;
227349;A Bond reboot that explores the fascinating early career of 007.;
227350;"<ORGANIZATION>""Casino Royale</ORGANIZATION> sees Bond himself recharged with fresh toughness and arrogance, along with balancing hints of sadism and humanity, just as the fabled series is reinvigorated by going back to basics.""";
227351;[<PERSON>Craig</PERSON> is] arguably the best pure actor ever to play the part, and he is unquestionably the fittest.;
227352;<PERSON>Craig</PERSON> acquits himself well in this thoroughly enjoyable, superbly directed Bond flick, although it drags a bit in the third act.;
227353;More than a few women in the audience were taken by <PERSON>Craig</PERSON>'s baby blues, but can Bond really see out of those things or are they decorative adornments - like throw pillows?;
227354;This is a Bond with great body but no soul.;
227355;There's one whopper of a reason why <ORGANIZATION>Casino Royale</ORGANIZATION> is the hippest, highest-octane Bond film in ages, and his name is <PERSON>Daniel Craig</PERSON>.;
227356;Taking the world's greatest spy back to his roots as a raw, impressionable brute whose cockiness at times fails him and who can lose his heart to a woman was a keen stroke of intelligence.;
227357;This Bond will be around for as long as <PERSON>Craig</PERSON> wants him to be but future franchise success depends as much on this level of writing ingenuity.;
227358;"<ORGANIZATION>""Casino Royale</ORGANIZATION>, though half an hour too long, is the first semi-serious stab at <ORGANIZATION>Fleming</ORGANIZATION>, and at the treacherous terrain that he marked out, since On <ORGANIZATION>Her Majesty's Secret Service</ORGANIZATION>, in <DATE>1969</DATE>.""";
227359;Everything old is new again in this leaner, meaner, back-to-basics re-boot. Think of it as 007's Batman Begins.;
227360;Casino Royale is everything you could ask for in a Bond movie, and more. Much more. Sometimes even more than is a good idea.;
227361;To say Casino Royale ranks among the best Bond offerings is not intended as backhanded praise.;
227362;Pure testosterone pleasure.;
227363;<PERSON>Daniel Craig</PERSON> is James Bond now and he ain't afraid to talk tough, kick *** and get his hands dirty doing it.;
227364;Successfully relaunches James Bond with tension-filled high stakes poker games ... and jaw-dropping action scenes that have to be seen to be believed.;
227365;By the time the film ends with a tantalizing 22nd episode tease, it's clear that <PERSON>Craig</PERSON> and co. have pretty much nailed all seven killer B elements of a memorable Bond.;
227366;Give <PERSON>Daniel Craig</PERSON> credit for this: he's created the first James Bond who scares you.;
227367;<PERSON>Craig</PERSON> is the best Bond since <PERSON>Sean Connery</PERSON> and maybe the only Bond ever who could have pulled off the stunts in <LOCATION>Casino Royale</LOCATION>.;
227368;This is the Bond movie Bond fans (and non-fans, too) are bound to love, giving us everything we want out of a Bond movie, and more... Among the very best movies of the year.;
227369;[E]xactly what I was hoping for, and everything I was expecting from the first Generation X James Bond... It's Bond's superhero origin story reconsidered from a perspective that respects and understands the authority and the intensity behind the character;
227370;This Bond is rough and raw ... despite his divinely piercing blue eyes, he might just as well have emerged from primordial sludge to do the bidding of <LOCATION>Beelzebub</LOCATION>.;
227371;Meet the new Bond. (Not) the same as the old Bond.;
227372;"<ORGANIZATION>""Casino Royale</ORGANIZATION> is the riskiest of Bonds, and it immediately establishes itself among the series' top tier because almost every gambit pays off.""";
227373;In <LOCATION>Casino Royale</LOCATION>, Bond is still learning to tame his impulses into a style, and he's all the more dangerous because of it.;
227374;A renewed sense of engagement informs director <ORGANIZATION>Martin Campbell</ORGANIZATION>'s tough, absorbing adaptation of the <DATE>1953</DATE> Ian <PERSON>Fleming</PERSON> novel, the one that started the whole 007 business.;
227375;<PERSON>Craig</PERSON> plays Bond so rough that his edges have edges, becoming a sex symbol with more in common with <PERSON>Harley Davidson</PERSON> than <PERSON>Sean Connery</PERSON>.;
227376;If Casino Royale had kept to a lean, mean 90 minutes, it could have been the perfect James Bond flick.;
227377;"All fears surrounding the future of cinema's longest running franchise are put to rest with <PERSON>Daniel Craig (</PERSON>\Layer Cake\"") more than capably filling 007's shoes in a Bond film that shatters formula constraints and delivers nail-biting action in a considerabl""";
227378;(<PERSON>Daniel) Craig</PERSON> makes an excellent Bond. ... Like (<PERSON>Sean) Connery</PERSON>, he creates an aura of danger and unpredictability.;
227379;<PERSON>Daniel Craig</PERSON> hardly needs me fawning all over him. I'll just add to the litany of praises that I think he's a much better runner than <PERSON>Tom Cruise</PERSON>.;
227380;<PERSON>Craig</PERSON> with his tightly-coiled intensity and rampant charisma injects a welcome dose of serious testosterone back into the franchise;
227381;Using his stocky build, <PERSON>Shar</PERSON>-<PERSON>Pei</PERSON> good looks, and two lethal weapons commonly referred to as hands, <PERSON>Craig</PERSON> owns the frame as the legendary spy.;
227382;Here's the biggest surprise of the year: the new <ORGANIZATION>Casino Royale</ORGANIZATION> is the best James Bond film since Goldfinger (<DATE>1964</DATE>).;
227383;I am overcome with glee after watching <ORGANIZATION>Casino Royale</ORGANIZATION>. I love this movie.;
227384;For the first time ever, James Bond is tough, smart, sexy, smooth, witty... and sort of three-dimensional. Welcome to the <DATE>21st century</DATE>, Mr. <PERSON>Bond</PERSON>.;
227385;You're more likely to find the new James Bond taking target practice in tin can alley than canoodling at the <ORGANIZATION>Playboy Mansion</ORGANIZATION>. If <PERSON>Pierce Bronson</PERSON> was <PERSON>Zach Morris</PERSON>, then <PERSON>Daniel Craig</PERSON> is <PERSON>A.C. Slater</PERSON>.;
227386;This is the best <PERSON>James Bond</PERSON> film in at least 17 years, and <PERSON>Daniel Craig</PERSON> might be the best 007 ... ever.;
227387;As portrayed by <PERSON>Daniel Craig</PERSON>, 007 now has more depth and emotion than ever, and the result is one of the best Bond movies ever made.;
227388;I am proud to say the haters can all stuff it. <PERSON>Daniel Craig</PERSON> is the perfect new James Bond, and may have rescued the franchise.;
227389;They got a lot right with this new rebooted Bond, but -- let me get this straight -- when Bond and the Bad Guy have their big confrontation, it's...a poker game?;
227390;performs a succinct Ctrl-Alt-Delete on the flailing series;
227391;... the Bond franchise has always been fortunate in its choice of leading men, and <PERSON>Craig</PERSON> is one of their wisest picks yet.;
227392;<PERSON>Martin Campbell</PERSON> (who also directed <ORGANIZATION>Pierce Brosnan</ORGANIZATION>'s first outing as Bond in Goldeneye), has chosen to give us a Bond who's both metaphorically and literally stripped bare. Let me take this opportunity to thank him for both.;
227393;The audience isn't distracted from <PERSON>Craig</PERSON>'s baby steps as a Bond with doomsday devices, underwater-car escapades or henchmen with deadly hats. The plot focuses on a Bond more vulnerable and more lethal than any of his predecessors.;
227394;Bond's sixth incarnation is a refreshing, if only too lengthy, change of pace... Connery fans will probably find themselves the biggest fan of <PERSON>Craig</PERSON>'s work.;
227395;A solid action-adventure in the modern mold...expertly crafted in every respect. But it's also just a little anonymous amidst so many similar films.;
227396;The latest James Bond vehicle finds the British spy leaner, meaner and a whole lot darker.;
227397;Half an hour too long and with too many villains we really can't place in the plot, Casino Royale nevertheless proves you seldom go wrong if you make a movie that leaves you stirred, not shaken.;
227398;<PERSON>Craig</PERSON>'s detractors, who've complained since the blond actor was cast last year, will have to give up the cry: On first acquaintance, he seems like the best all-around Bond since <PERSON>Sean Connery</PERSON>.;
227399;"<ORGANIZATION>""Casino Royale</ORGANIZATION> unveils <PERSON>Daniel Craig</PERSON> as the new James Bond and, excepting <PERSON>Sean Connery</PERSON>, he's the best.""";
227400;The movie also travels the dark path of the book, which I won't detail here, but just know that Bond has to suffer for his art.;
227401;<PERSON>Craig</PERSON> is a broken-nose-handsome character actor in what is essentially a character study, albeit one with acrobatic, in-your-face action scenes.;
227402;Casino Royale takes a huge gamble that moviegoers are ready for a fresh take on James Bond. And it wins the bet.;
227403;Brilliant director <ORGANIZATION>Martin Campbell</ORGANIZATION> brings in the best Bond film since Goldfinger, one with an actual script to go with the stunts, even if <PERSON>Craig</PERSON> can't compete with <PERSON>Connery</PERSON> when it comes to bon mots.;
227404;You who carped that the 007 films had devolved into a catalog of fresh gadgets and stale puns, eat crow. You who said that the <ORGANIZATION>Austin Powers superspy</ORGANIZATION> spoofs made James Bond irrelevant, behave.;
227405;may not exactly reinvent the Bond movie as we know it, but it certainly offers a different slant... with <PERSON>Craig</PERSON> firmly in control there's a real sense of urgency in both the action and the romance...;
227406;Casino Royale is the best Bond film in thirty years. <PERSON>Daniel Craig</PERSON> brings a toughness and edge long absent from the role.;
227407;Good. Really, really good. Maybe, in fact, the best entry since On <ORGANIZATION>Her Majesty's Secret Service</ORGANIZATION>. No offense to <ORGANIZATION>St. Connery</ORGANIZATION> is intended, but, man, <PERSON>Craig</PERSON> has it down cold.;
227408;"The tone isn't as cute or vapid as most installments; it's actually a little sinister compared with any recent Bond.";
227409;"<ORGANIZATION>""Casino Royale</ORGANIZATION> tries to have it both ways, moving toward the genuine while still grasping for the outlandish. The result is a film that's caught between caution and abandonment. And that's probably not a place where James Bond wants to be.""";
227410;Meet the new Bond, not the same as the old Bond -- and thank God for that.;
227411;Now I'm glad they didn't euthanize James Bond, because Casino Royale is the best movie of the series in almost 40 years.;
227412;Back to basics, is the idea.;
227413;Fans of anyone other than <PERSON>Sean Connery</PERSON> who has played James Bond may want to look away, because admirers of <PERSON>Ian Fleming</PERSON>'s 007 novels are almost bound to agree that <PERSON>Daniel Craig</PERSON> is the best Bond since <PERSON>Sean</PERSON>.;
227414;The striking thing about <PERSON>Craig</PERSON>'s performance is that he seems to have been able to tune out over 40 years of screen history and approach Bond as just another role.;
227415;Those who always hoped the series would morph into something approaching realism (if only cinematic), will find their wait justly rewarded.;
227416;Back are the virtues of the original <PERSON>Ian Fleming</PERSON> novels, seen only fleetingly in previous films.;
227417;'I understand double-0s have a very short life expectancy,' says the new James Bond in <LOCATION>Casino Royale</LOCATION>. Let's hope not. It'd be swell if this Bond stuck around.;
227418;"<ORGANIZATION>""Casino Royale</ORGANIZATION> proves that back to basics is a good place to be -- unless you end up aping the same incongruous spirit that hobbled your predecessor.""";
227419;This <PERSON>James Bond</PERSON> is a successful reinvention of a mythic character, an immensely enjoyable action film -- maybe the year's best -- and proof positive that, after nearly half a century, the movies' most popular series still has a lot of life left in it.;
227420;There's little to link this thrilling action flick with the clichéd redundancy that the 007 movies had become.;
227421;If this franchise is indeed being reinvented (and it needed to be), it's going to be very interesting to see how <PERSON>Craig</PERSON> continues shaking and stirring his character's icy cocktail of baleful cruelty and suave assurance.;
227422;Of course, we don't really go to Bond movies for the dialogue and the romance. We go for the action, and on that front Casino Royale delivers -- if, like everything else about the picture, in a refreshingly downsized way.;
227423;This exceedingly clever reincarnation, reclamation and reinvigoration of a franchise that has had its ups and downs stands taller than ever.;
227424;Die-hard fans may miss Q and <LOCATION>Miss Moneypenny</LOCATION> or the boys-and-their-toys gadgets or even the smirky tone. But in their stead is a riveting picture that, for all its globetrotting glamour and eyepopping action, demands we take this new Bond seriously.;
227425;The script updates <PERSON>Ian Fleming</PERSON>'s first Bond novel to a post-9/11 world and scales back the silliness that always seems to creep into the series.;
227426;Spectacular action -- and a cool new Bond. But the film goes long and an important romance isn't quite sold. Nor is the plot terribly solid.;
227427;One of the best, and most lavish, action films in years, <ORGANIZATION>Casino Royale</ORGANIZATION> sets a new standard for espionage adventures that will be hard to top.;
227428;The most believable Bond since the days of <PERSON>Connery</PERSON> and for the first time in decades, I left the theater with the distinct reaction that I wanted to be James Bond.;
227429;Blond. James Blond.;
227430;finally brings the action at fist's length;
227431;[Casino Royale] not only simultaneously acknowledges and confounds audience expectations, but also neatly confirms that <PERSON>Daniel Craig</PERSON>'s intriguing and charismatic tyro agent is cut from quite different cloth to his Savile Row-tailored predecessors.;
227432;"The action scenes are great; <PERSON>Craig</PERSON> makes a very interesting hero; the plot is generally logical. But...the story reaches what feels like the <PERCENT>end %</PERCENT>u2026 then goes on for another 20 or 25 minutes in order to set up one more reversal.";
227433;The man with the license to kill has become the man with the license to bore.;
227434;I'm actually looking forward to the next Bond film--something I didn't think I would ever say with a straight face.;
227435;I've never been totally enthralled with the Bond series, but if the films follow in the quality footsteps of <LOCATION>Casino Royale</LOCATION>, I can't wait to see <PERSON>Daniel Craig</PERSON> in another 007 adventure.;
227436;"Call it \caveman vérité.\""""";
227437;Casino Royale is the best Bond film in decades and the best in all honesty since Thunderball. It moves the franchise in an exciting new direction.;
227438;This is no omnipotent superspy. He's a government bagman, making messy problems disappear in equally messy ways.;
227439;The movie is agreeably free from bad puns, loony gadgets and daffy action set pieces that have our hero parasailing over glaciers.;
227440;There's clearly life in the old dog yet.;
227441;Welcome to the new world of <ORGANIZATION>MI6</ORGANIZATION>'s most storied agent.;
227442;<PERSON>Craig</PERSON> is a marvel, but the decision to have Bond engaged in a game of Hold 'Em poker is a betrayal of the character and an embarrassing bit of pandering. Small detail, I know.;
227443;Crass product placement, implausible dialogue, plot points that drag on, <ORGANIZATION>Casino Royale</ORGANIZATION> has them all. The reason none of that really matters is <PERSON>Daniel Craig</PERSON>.;
227444;A definite see for Bonders like myself who can accept the hard-hitting <PERSON>Craig</PERSON>, <PERSON>Daniel Craig</PERSON>.;
227445;"<ORGANIZATION>""Casino Royale</ORGANIZATION> is a step in the right direction for the Bond franchise. But it's a small, tentative step.""";
227446;This Bond is less urbane and the screenplay is short on wit:but the stunning physical action makes up for these flaws.;
227447;Who wants to see Bond learn a lesson about ego, as if he were <PERSON>Greg Brady</PERSON> in his '<PERSON>Johnny Bravo</PERSON>' phase?;
227448;It's The Spy Who Came In From the Warmth.;
227449;[<PERSON>Craig</PERSON>'s] portrayal feels grittier and more complex than previous 007s. This is also partly the result of a better script, by <PERSON>Neal Purvis</PERSON>, <PERSON>Robert Wade</PERSON> and Oscar winner <PERSON>Paul Haggis</PERSON>, as well as top-notch directing by <ORGANIZATION>Martin Campbell</ORGANIZATION>.;
227450;Reservations aside, the film marks the beginning of a new phase in James Bond's history, and it promises to be a gripping one.;
227451;Gone or reshaped are most of the conceits that have made Bond movies seem like an exercise in parody and nostalgia.;
227452;With <PERSON>Craig</PERSON> in the role, a Bond film suddenly seems like something to be taken seriously.;
227453;<PERSON>Craig</PERSON> is marvelous, showing a depth and grit of character that easily makes him the most realistic Bond since <PERSON>Sean Connery</PERSON>.;
227454;It's not as bad as Die Another Day, and not up to the jolly mayhem of the best films in the series.;
227455;There's so much that's very right about Casino Royale -- from the knockout opening action sequence in <LOCATION>Madagascar</LOCATION> to the sizzling chemistry between <PERSON>Craig</PERSON> and Green -- that you leave the theater happily shaken and stirred.;
227456;<PERSON>Craig</PERSON> is right for this revision/revival, bullet-headed and ruggedly handsome, whose steely eyes are cold enough to suggest a remorseless killer, blue enough to do the other things that Bond must do.;
227457;See Casino Royale for a Bond you've never seen before, and then imagine him in a film two-thirds the size. Here's hoping the writers of the next Bond movie employ the same personal trainer that <PERSON>Craig</PERSON> did to keep the script tight and lean.;
227458;"<ORGANIZATION>""Casino Royale</ORGANIZATION> isn't perfect, but it's surprisingly entertaining, even exciting for long stretches, and <PERSON>Craig</PERSON> manages to find new dimensions to a character that had long ago become a tired caricature. Everything old is new again, indeed.""";
227459;After seeing this performance one can only be excited at the prospect of watching <PERSON>Craig</PERSON>'s Bond mature and change over the course of several films.;
227460;Don't read any of the reviews beforehand, including this one. Just go. The less you know about the film going in, the more fun it is to watch -- no hype, no expectations high or low, no preconceptions.;
227461;What, no jet packs? No world-conquering supervillains orbiting the planet? No preference for shaken martinis?;
227462;Now this is more like it.;
227463;Thankfully, the first film with <PERSON>Daniel Craig</PERSON> as Bond does have the more serious, <LOCATION>earnest</LOCATION> tone of the earliest <PERSON>Sean Connery</PERSON> films, which means less tomfoolery and silliness, and more action.;
227464;If the goal was to give Bond vivid new life, <ORGANIZATION>Casino Royale</ORGANIZATION> must be called a success. This Bond is not only licensed to kill but eager to get on with the job.;
227465;You don't need a weatherman to tell you the 21st installment in the franchise brings an invigorating chill to the air.;
227466;Not only is <PERSON>Craig</PERSON> by far and way the best Bond since <PERSON>Sean Connery</PERSON>, he will probably end up being even better with another Bond film or two under his belt.;
227467;Let the purists squawk: In <PERSON>Daniel Craig</PERSON>, the Bond franchise has finally found a 007 whose cruel charisma rivals that of <PERSON>Sean Connery</PERSON>.;
227468;"In the film, Bond must gamble to survive and grow; the producers of this franchise did the same - and in both cases, the chips are up.";
227469;"Is Bond back? Not completely; not yet. But <PERSON>Craig</PERSON> has taken the franchise off life-support, and it'll be interesting to see where he goes with it from here.";
227470;<PERSON>Daniel Craig</PERSON> is all THAT and a bag of chips. Kudos to the new Bond regime.;
227471;<PERSON>Craig</PERSON> is a thrilling Bond, maybe the best ever. For a girl raised on the glories of <PERSON>Sean Connery</PERSON> it must be admitted this guy fits the part top to bottom better than anyone who has come before.;
227472;<PERSON>Daniel Craig</PERSON> embodies the cold, callous, calculating <PERSON>Ian Fleming</PERSON> spy - and it all adds up to terrific escapist entertainment.;
227473;Everyone's favorite British agent is still good for a punch, a shag, and a quip...Casino Royale gives the reborn franchise a second chance to grow up.;
227474;<PERSON>Craig</PERSON> plays [Bond] a lot rougher than we're used to, giving us the sense of a street kid who got some breaks in getting an education and some polish...;
227475;<PERSON>Daniel Craig</PERSON> is the closest anyone has ever come to matching the original rugged scoundrel type that was pioneered by <PERSON>Sean Connery</PERSON>;
227476;The gamble was enormous, but in the end it pays off%u2026 big time.;
227477;There are a number of improvements in this movie over the previous films.;
227478;I haven't dug a James Bond movie this much in about, oh, I don't know, forever.;
227479;<ORGANIZATION>Royale</ORGANIZATION>'s amazing last scene had everyone in the audience clapping and cheering - at the same time the movie, just ends, with nothing really resolved, leaving you wanting more and waiting breathlessly for the next installment.;
227480;The defibrillator to the heart has worked wonders.;
227481;The new Bond is at least as good as perennial favorite <PERSON>Sean Connery</PERSON> in the role, and his first vehicle...is the bracing breath of fresh air Bond has been gasping for.;
227482;Though the <PERSON>Broccoli</PERSON> family... goofed by not jettisoning the old players behind the scenes, they made a smart decision with their new Bond.;
227483;<PERSON>Craig</PERSON> is the best thing about Casino Royale, which for all of its positive steps in the right direction could still use some more dusting off.;
227484;The film opens with a bang, only to flatline 30 minutes later.;

227520;They still have the bad guys and lots of action because you can't have Bond without all that, but you get more of a sense of the man behind the martinis.;
227521;A muscular action film blissfully free of winking.;
227522;It's neither an exciting thriller nor an interesting study in character. And there is no memorable iconic moment featuring Bond, his baddies or his beauties, the kind that you take home from the cinema and that stays with you.;

227544;I consider <PERSON>Daniel Craig</PERSON> to be the most effective and appealing of the six actors who have played 007, and that includes even <PERSON>Sean Connery</PERSON>.;

227571;This is a much more serious Bond than we've seen in many years. <PERSON>Daniel Craig</PERSON> inhabits the dark side of the secret agent really well, he is absolutely the best Bond since <ORGANIZATION>Connery</ORGANIZATION>.;
227572;<PERSON>Craig</PERSON>'s humanised, more flawed interpretation of the role balances <ORGANIZATION>Campbell</ORGANIZATION>'s physical direction and co-writer <PERSON>Paul Haggis</PERSON>'s sparing wit, while <ORGANIZATION>Eva Green</ORGANIZATION> provides an alluring love interest.;
227573;I think this is a very intelligent film for a Bond film, and certainly one of the most enjoyable.;

227585;Basically, <PERSON>Craig</PERSON>'s Bond is a new and individual creation.;
227586;<PERSON>Craig</PERSON> brings beef, biff and a slightly lonely dimension to the character. He's a fine actor and he has some of the working-class bile of the young <PERSON>Michael Caine</PERSON>. A new <ORGANIZATION>James Bond</ORGANIZATION> has certainly arrived.;

227588;For fans of the no-nonsense, rugged sexuality of the <PERSON>Sean Connery</PERSON> original model, <PERSON>Craig</PERSON> is the heir to that hallowed throne.;
227589;While <PERSON>Craig</PERSON> owns the movie, he gets much capable support. Green's Bond babe believably has more on the ball than many of her predecessors, while <PERSON>Dench</PERSON>, returning as M, Bond's boss, has perfected her sighs of exasperation.;
227590;"When Bond kills an adversary in a hotel stairwell, the violence is nasty and brutal - and you feel bystander <PERSON>Vesper</PERSON>'s shock and revulsion too. She doesn't merely wince and get over it, as so many of her predecessors did; she's clearly traumatised.";
