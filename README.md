# team_quandt_internal
repository for our internal workshop

# 12.06.2023
## prerequisites:
### first read the steps below
- if you want to continue to use R/Python I recommend installing everything below (but you can also totally do that after the workshop :) )
  - for the workshop I recommend to install R/R-Studio but to use colab for python (because we focus on R)
- if you want to install stuff later and want to start coding directly look at the colab instructions
  - be aware of the following caveats regarding colab:
    - it is google product, you need a google account
    - it can be quite slow compared to a local install
    - it requires a stable internet connection
- If you have any questions on the installation or want to troubleshoot, feel free to contact me beforehand or afterwards

### if you **don't** yet have R and RStudio, start *here*
